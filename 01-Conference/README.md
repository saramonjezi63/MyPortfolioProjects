# Conference Project

This is where my web development journey started. The "Conference Project" is all about simple HTML and CSS. It's like the first chapter in my portfolio story.

In this project, I dipped my toes into coding and created basic web pages. It might seem basic now, but it's where I began. As you explore my portfolio, you'll see how I've tackled more challenging stuff in later projects.
